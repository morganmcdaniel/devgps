        <p>Just like Amazon identifies the next most likely thing you want to buy, and Google identifies the next most likely thing you want to click, DevGPS is working to identify the next most likely industry a region can do.
        </p>
        <p>Economic growth is one of the most important goals of local governments, yet policy makers often lack clear data-driven tools to evaluate growth strategies. This leads to sub-optimal utilization of their limited resources, which can lead to less jobs created and lower economic growth rates. DevGPS is committed to facilitating targeted economic growth strategy that creates more jobs and economic growth.
        </p>
        <p>The heart of this approach is network analysis. We think about economies as driven by networks of people who use their unique skills to solve problems. Network effects allow bigger groups with more complex skills to solve bigger, more complex problems. That does not mean small groups can't compete - it just means that they need to be strategic. By understanding what you can do, what you could do, and how to get there, an area can make itself as competitive as possible. It can also better invest its limited resources.
        </p>
        <p>Very few cities will be New York City, Los Angeles, London, Paris, Beijing, or Tokyo. Many people would prefer that their cities look and feel very different than those big cities. DevGPS is about helping communities get where they want to go as efficiently as possible.
